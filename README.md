## 🔧 Technical Focus

DevOps | MLOps | Cloud Infrastructure

### 🖥 Systems & Scripting
- Linux (Ubuntu, CLI, shell scripting), Git, Bash, Zsh
- Python for automation, scripting, and glue code
- Build tools: Gradle, Maven, NPM

### 🧱 Infrastructure as Code & Config Management
- Terraform (IaC): AWS + EKS provisioning, modular infra
- Ansible (CM): server config, playbooks, automation pipelines

### 🚀 CI/CD & Pipelines
- Jenkins + GitHub Actions for end-to-end CI/CD
- Artifact management: DockerHub, Nexus, ECR
- Release automation to AWS (EC2, Docker Compose, EKS)
- CI/CD integration with K8s and container registries

### 📦 Containers & Orchestration
- Docker: image creation, Compose, volume management
- Kubernetes: local + EKS, Helm charts, deployment strategies
- K8s operators and secrets management

### ☁️ Cloud Platforms
- AWS: IAM, EC2, VPC, ECR, S3, EKS, CloudFormation
- DigitalOcean for smaller scale deployments
- (Upcoming) Azure for multi-cloud readiness

### 📈 Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus + Alertmanager + Grafana
- Monitoring K8s clusters, AWS services, apps, third-party APIs

### 🤖 MLOps & ML Infrastructure
- MLflow: experiment tracking, model registry, reproducibility
- FastAPI for serving ML models (PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Reproducible training & inference pipelines with Docker + CI/CD
